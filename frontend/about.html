			<h1>About This Website</h1>
		</header>
		<main id="about">
			<p>
				We think Python is kind of useless without libraries (unless you're one
				of those mythical beings who writes neural nets in raw Python).
			</p>
			<p>
				While PyPI is amazing, it's designed for hosting, not exploring. We
				wanted something that feels more like a recommendation engine for your
				next import statement.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's why we think it is nice to have a website where Python developers
				can find what fits in their projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of these libraries were lovingly stolen (legally!) from the
				legendary
				<a href="https://github.com/dylanhogg/awesome-python" target="_blank"
					>awesome-python</a
				>
				list, plus a few more sprinkled in for flavor.
			</p>

			<p>
				This project is open-source, so if you spot a bug, typo, or know a cool
				library that deserves the spotlight,
				<a href="https://github.com/hasboi/doespythonhaveit" target="_blank"
					>hop in and contribute!</a
				>
				We adore good pull requests almost as much as clean Python syntax.
